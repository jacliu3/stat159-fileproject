\section{Data}

The primary data set we are using is the \href{https://ed-public-download.apps.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv}{most recent College ScoreCard} which contains approximately 2000 metrics for 7704 degree-granting institution across U.S. These metrics include demographic data, student academics, costs, student body, financial aid, completion, repayment information, etc. We choose to focus on the most recent year dataset because it contains most up-to-date information. Among all metrics we will select predictors from following three clusters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Repayment}: shows loan performance metrics and borrowers' behavior afgter graduation
  \item\textbf{Financial Aid}: Amount of debt that students can expect to borrow
  \item\textbf{Earnings}: data on earnings and employment of former students
\end{itemize}
Our first task is to clean the dataset, select the right variable to predict, and most relevant predictors by transforming and segementing the dataset.
