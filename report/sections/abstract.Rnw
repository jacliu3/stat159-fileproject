\section{Abstract}

\href{https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/}{\textit {College Scorecard dataset}} is released by U.S Department of Education in September 2015, as a means of providing transparent information for over 7000 degree-granting institutions to students and families who are making decisions concerning recieving secondary education. This information includes the cost of attendance, post-graduate earnings and debt, and financial aid. For credit institutions who are eager to provide more loans to college students, they need to be selective when choosing the 'less risky' colleges to at which they will be giving their loans. In other words, they want to ensure that a college's loan recievers are able to pay loans back after they graduate and will enter the job market rather than default. This paper will explore the correlations between characteristics of colleges and their loan-recieving students' repayment ability. We use predictive modeling with different methods to help credit institutions make informed decisions when evaluating the borrowing risk of each customer.
