##Abstract

[_College Scorecard dataset_](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) is released by U.S Department of Education in September 2015, as a means of providing transparent information of over 7000 degree-granting institutions to students and families who are making decisions upon recieving secondary education. These information include the attending cost, post-graduate earnings and debt, and financial aid. For credit institutions who are eager to providing more loans to college students, they need to be selective when choosing the 'less risky' colleges to release their loans to. In other words, they want to ensure that a college's loan recievers are able to pay loans back after they graduate and enter job market rather than default. This paper will explore the correlations between characteristics of colleges and their loan-recieving students' repayment ability. Especially, we use data models to help credit institutions make informed decisions when evaluating the borrowing risk to each customer.
