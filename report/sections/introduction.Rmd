##Introduction

We hope to create data models that can make predictions regarding the loan cohort default rate (CDR) based on factors that represents students' earnings and financial aid. In order to better inform loan decision, we classify all institutions into high-risk (CDR3 > 0.15)and low-risk (CDR < 0.15) two categories. Our prediction will also tell which category an institution will fall in given some specific metrics. There are two types of model we use to fit the data: 

-Logistic Regression
-Gradient Boosting Machine

We will perform the analysis on the data set [Most-Recent-Cohort-All-Data-Elements](https://ed-public-download.apps.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv). In each analysis, we will tune the parameters for each respective model using 5-fold cross validation and then evaluate the best model by using the highest classification precision on the test set. A more detailed explanation can be found in _Methods_ section.
